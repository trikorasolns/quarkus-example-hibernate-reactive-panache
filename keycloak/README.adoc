== Set Up (version 15.0.2)

==== Firewall

Open firewall ports:

TIP: It is not mandatory to perform this step unless you have compatibility issues
with yor firewall.

[source,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --add-port 8090/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port 8043/tcp --permanent
----


==== Create a podman for keyclock

IMPORTANT: It is necessary to map two ports since one is needed for the keycloak console.
In our case, we map the 8090 with the 8080 because we are currently using the 8080
in another project.

[source,bash]
----
podman pod create -p 8090:8080 -p 8543:8443 --name trikora_keycloak_quarkus_example_pod
----

===== Delete the previous pod
[source,bash]
----
podman pod rm trikora_keycloak_quarkus_example_pod
----

NOTE: You can see if there is any pod process active with the command:
`podman pod ps --all`, therefore, you can get the name of the pods which are running in order to kill them.


==== Run the pod

Firstly it is necessary to copy the realm.json in the tmp/keycloak_tmp/ (local) directory. As this directory is volatile, you have to do this operation each time you restart your PC.
You need to be located in your project root directory in order to perform the following commands.
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /tmp/keycloak_tmp/
cp src/test/resources/trikora-realm.json /tmp/keycloak_tmp/
----
Then we can execute:

NOTE: In the current version of keycloak, it is not possible to run keycloak with an initial database, so we have to run the pod with an empty keycloak and then
import the realm.json with the command line (see below). For that reason the flag `-e KEYCLOAK_IMPORT=/tmp/trikora-realm.json` has been removed from the run command.

[source,bash]
----
podman run --name trikora_keycloak_quarkus_example --security-opt label=disable \
  --rm --pod trikora_keycloak_quarkus_example_pod \
  -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin  \
  -v /tmp/keycloak_tmp/:/tmp/ \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:15.0.2
----

NOTE: the --rm flag is set for deleting the pod after the execution. You can kill the process with `^C`.

== Actions in the keycloak console

* Link to keycloak console: https://localhost:8543/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/quarkus

==== Roles
* We can access the roles section by the left navigator in the main page or clicking here:
https://localhost:8543/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/quarkus/roles

* In this section we can add roles to our application that will be saved in the realms.json that we have located in the tmp directory.

==== User Management

* If the user section, we can edit all the information regarding the user such as the email, password ...
but indeed we have the possibility of assigning new roles to the user as well as enroll them to different groups.


== Security Management
* In this section we will describe how keycloak filter the URLs with the proper permissions.

* Firstly, we have to locate in Clients -> backend-service -> Authorization -> Settings -> Resources.
Link: https://localhost:8543/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/quarkus/clients/0ac5df91-e044-4051-bd03-106a3a5fb9cc/authz/resource-server/resource

* Then, we have to create a new resource where we will establish the URLs that are going to be restricted. For doing so, there is a button `Create` in the upper-right side of the main layout.

* After that, it is necessary to add an Associated Permission to the Resource, now we have to decide who is going to have access to the service by creating a new policy. A policy, may be a Role, Group, Client scope or even a single user. Once we have linked the policy to the resource, just the desired users could access to the services.

* If a user without the proper permissions tries to access the service, keycloak will return a http response with status 403 (FORBIDDEN).

== Backup and Restore
* As the keycloak admin console does not allow exporting users, we highly recommend using the command line solution in order to fully export your project.

=== Export
* In this section we will describe how to export a realm.json in a single file from a running container using podman.

----
IMPORTANT: When a realm is imported from the command line, the keycloak console is not updated due to a version bug. In order to see the imported realm, it is
necessary to create another realm (empty, only need to enter the realm name). This action will force the console table to be updated, this is a keycloak bug so
we hope that it could be fixed in futures releases.

== Import several files in a single realm
* If we have stored the data of the project split in several files, we can merge it in a single project just by importing the files as they are a list separated by commas:
-Dkeycloak.import=/tmp/realm1.json,/tmp/realm2.json

WARNING: You cannot use the keycloak.import parameter with keycloak.migration.X parameters.
If you use these parameters together, keycloak.import parameter will be ignored. The keycloak.import mechanism ignores the realms which already exist in the project.
The keycloak.import mechanism is convenient for development purposes, but if more flexibility is needed, use the keycloak.migration.X parameters.

== Troubleshooting

=== Permission denied when running the pod

*Problem*
[source]
----
FATAL [org.keycloak.services] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 58) Error during startup: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /tmp/trikora-realm.json (Permission denied)
----

*Cause*
The pod has not enough permissions for accessing the realm.json file.

*Solution*
When running the pod, we should add the `--security-opt label=disable` flag.

=== Cannot import a realm when running the pod
*Problem*

[source]
----
07:37:13,702 WARN  [org.keycloak.services] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 68) KC-SERVICES0005: Unable to import realm trikorasolutions from file /tmp/trikora-realm.json.: java.lang.RuntimeException: Script upload is disabled
	at org.keycloak.keycloak-authz-policy-common@15.0.2//org.keycloak.authorization.policy.provider.js.JSPolicyProviderFactory.updatePolicy(JSPolicyProviderFactory.java:125)
	at org.keycloak.keycloak-authz-policy-common@15.0.2//org.keycloak.authorization.policy.provider.js.JSPolicyProviderFactory.onImport(JSPolicyProviderFactory.java:70)
----
*Cause*
From keycloak version 7.0.1 onwards, it is not possible to import a realm.json file since it is considered a deprecated way.

*Solution*
Adding the flag "-e -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.upload_scripts=enabled" does not work, so the only solution is to run podman with an empty master realm and then
import ours from the command line.

Other possible solution to try would be launch keycloak in version 6.0.0 with the realm and then update keycloak.
